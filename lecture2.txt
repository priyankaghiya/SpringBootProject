if our server is at the same machine and we have to tell thhe browser that our server is at the
same computer then we can say it by "localhost"
now see which server we have tomcat server and to identify it we have 8080
wamp server 3306
now tomcat will have many project now which project to call for that @requestmapping(value=stdhome)

when we want to send any HTML file to your client then manke a seperate method in that method make the 
object of ModelAnd View and whatever file you want to send  setViewName ma write the name of that file in the 
and return that object

NOW stdhome thi mycontroller class call hoga and these class contains many methods so how only this method 
will br called?So for that also we have to do request mapping.

Before the method we always write getMapping or postMapping if we it is with parameters then write postMapping

we will write these in the browser 
http://localhost:8080/stdhome/

now here in our program we have written getMapping(value="/") so in the browser due to the last slash 
it will automatically call these method.
