SpringBoot would take out the values from the object and will fire the query automatically.
SpringBoot is used to make dynamic web application using java.
After creating project if we want to add dependecy then search in google on Oracle site.
In Spring Framework when we want to add jar file add dependency instead, that dependency
when the prject runs springboot will go to the .m2 folder and in that it will go on google
and will extract all the libraries in the .m2 folder.
All HTML files must be saved in the templates folder.In template folder inside resources folder.

pom.xml : it contains all dependency library for current project like web,jpa,mysql etc.
(it is called dependency injection) now,if first project is created or downloaded from 
the spring initilizr site , all the required jar file will be extracted or downloaded from 
internet by the spring framework itself automatically and all this jar files and libraries 
will be stored inside m2 folder. So, if in future in the same folder or in new other 
project if this jar library is required, spring framework will automatically fetch this library
from .m2 folder and if it is not found in .m2 folder then spring framework will fetch or download 
library from internet.

appliction.properties rename it as application.yml : application.yml file is used to specify 
database driver,server and port number , database name , username and passward.
